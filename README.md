These projects were made to demonstrate several skills I have learned using R Studio. They are in the format of a Rmd. file which is a built-in function within R
that can convert any script into easily readable documents. The file named "Exponential Smoothing" is 100% complete and can be uploaded to R Studio to be knit using R Markdown, converting it into a HTML, DOC, or PDF file. The "COVID Forecast" document however is still a work in progress.
